Hooks
---------
Hooks are a new feature addition in React version 16.8 which allow you to use React features without having to write a class.

ex. State of component
Hooks don't work inside classes
Avoid the whole confusion with 'this' keyword
Allow you to reuse stateful logic.
Organize the logic inside a component into reusable isolated units


Rules of Hooks
---------------
1) Only call Hooks at the Top Level
   Don't call Hooks inside loops,conditions, or nested functions
2) Only call Hooks from React functions
   call them from within React Functions components and not just any regular JavaScript function


useState Hooks summary
------------------------
In classes, the state is always an object.

with the useState hook , it can object , array, boolean, number, string etc...

The  useState hook returns an array with 2 elements.

The first element is the current value of the state, and the second element is a state setter function.

New state value depends on the previous state value ? you can pass a function to the setter function.

When dealing with objects or arrays, always make sure to spread your state variable and then call the setter function.


useEffect Hooks summary
-----------------------
The Effect Hooks lets you perform side effects in functional components.
 It is a close replacement for componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount.
